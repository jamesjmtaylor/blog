<p>Well, my monthly objectives shifted again before I was able to fully realize them. I got pulled off my personal projects by an outside offer to work on an iOS and Android travel app in my spare time. I’m sinking a lot of time into it in order to get everything to match the designer&rsquo;s specifications, but it’s really rewarding to implement something so artfully envisioned. The designer is using https://app.</p>

<p>Last month the majority of the development team in Portland made a business trip to the Steelcase International Headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan. While we were there we also visited the Steelcase Kentwood Factory. The whole trip really put it into perspective for us. Steelcase itself is over a century old and takes in more than 4.5 billion dollars in annual revenue, employing tens of thousands of employees. Their Kentwood plant (which is only one of five factories) has 3, eight hour shifts working around the clock.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! I realize that I’ve been gone for a bit, but a lot has happened since. I recently got a full time position with Steelcase in Portland, Oregon as a software developer on their new mobile team. The idea is that we’ll be integrating mobile applications with their furniture IoT. IoT stands for “Internet of Things”, which is just a fancy way of summing up everything that’s connected to the internet, from the lowly bluetooth beacons all the way to the vaunted supercomputers of the modern age.</p>

<p>Well, as Eisenhower once said “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” The week before last I received opportunities to interview at Steelcase, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC), as well as several smaller startups. Steelcase alone has occupied 16 hours of time, primarily due to the six hour round-trip commutes both of the two-hour in-person interviews have necessitated. Additionally, the WA UTC position has prompted me to revisit my studies of C#, which I’m honestly a little rusty on.</p>

<p>I know it’s Wednesday, but I wanted to wait until after election day so I could provide my own spin on the results. If you’re not politically inclined, by all means, skip to the paragraph after next for the month’s agile objectives.
When populism originally emerged in the 1890’s it’s rallying cry was that “the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few” (sound familiar?</p>
