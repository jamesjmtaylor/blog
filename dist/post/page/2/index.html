<p>A podcast that I listen to, the Coder Radio, recently discussed how overhyped the field of Artificial Intelligence was and how the marketing departments of companies use the term when they shouldn’t. Which got me to thinking about when the term artificial intelligence should &amp; shouldn’t apply. Intelligence is defined by Google Dictionary as “the ability to acquire and apply knowledge”. Pretty straightforward. IQ tests after all are claimed to be biased against the uneducated because they test the application of knowledge that some individuals haven’t had a chance to acquire.</p>

A lot of software development is more general than the idiosyncrasies of this framework over that. Over the last year I&rsquo;ve come across a few pretty handy rules of thumb to use while planning or implementing features. A few of these are more technical (i.e. web tokens) but were included because their application spans a breadth of platforms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last posted. Truth be told I&rsquo;ve been rather busy with the final release of my Worldwide Equipment Guide 2015 apps for iOS and Android. I released the Android app at the end of April. The iOS app was just recently (as of June 1st) released. I&rsquo;ve already received some really positive feedback from the Army as well as some feature requests they&rsquo;d like. Top on the list is filtering by region or country to aid soldiers in preparation for a particular theater of operations.</p>

Way back in 2017 at Google I/O several architectural components were announced to help streamline Android development. Kotlin support was also announced. I&rsquo;ve only just recently been able to get around to doing an app that implements both simultaneously. I&rsquo;ve included some of my lessons learned below:
LiveData The Android MVVM pattern relies on a custom implementation of the MVVM and Observer patterns.</p>

<p>Most developers are pretty strongly opinionated about the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that they use. I will probably be no different eventually, but right now I’m still struggling to find Mr. Right. My first enterprise IDE was Eclipse Helios, way back in 2010. Prior to that I used some gosh-awful Ada native IDE that the government used to program tank ballistics computers and nuclear missiles. Eclipse at the time was awesome by comparison.</p>
