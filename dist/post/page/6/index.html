<p>I got a job! It’s a contract position to develop an iOS app and an Android app for a recruiting agency known as eXcell. I unfortunately can’t discuss the details of the contract proposal or the app due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that I signed, but after hearing the pitch from the project manager I’m confident I have the skills to implement what they’re looking for. I have to say that if it hadn’t been for my time at Coding Dojo, I wouldn’t have even begun to have considered myself qualified.</p>

<p>So, I’ve finished the coding dojo career course. Here are my biggest takeaways:
 Know the difference between Agency and Corporate recruiters and the advantages/disadvantages of each Look up the github of the team that you’re interviewing for. See what their code style is like and try to imitate it if you’re given a coding challenge. Connect with as many recruiters and Coding Dojo alumni as possible! Roshawn had us go through 10 pages of results for ‘Technical Recruiter’ and 10 pages for ‘Coding Dojo’ and request a connection with each and every one.</p>

<p>0730-It’s the last day of Coding Dojo. I’ve got mixed feelings about it. On the one hand I’m sad to be leaving a place where I learned so much so fast. On the other I’m excited and anxious to start my job search.
0900-Another mini-scrum. I’m going for quick-win objectives at this point. Add background music. Touch up the interface. Fix bugs. My only major objective is to implement the head-to-head interface and my chances of completing that prior to presentation seem dubious at best.</p>

<p>0730-I’m starting work on the Gwent Deck manager today. It’ll be the last full day to work on projects so I’ll have to get as much done as possible.
0900-We had our projects mini-scrum again. It looks like all the groups are coming along nicely. I’m looking forward to seeing what each has to present tomorrow.
1100-Algorithms time. Today we covered graphs, as well as three different ways that they can be implemented.</p>

<p>0730-Arrived early to get as much headway with Alamofire and SwiftyJSON as possible and… it doesn’t compile. xCode tells me there are now over 800 errors with the two pods. Apparently both of the libraries are still written in Swift 2. At some point Swift tried to update them to Swift 3 and it broke everything.
0900-After fighting it for over an hour I gave up. Everyone did their mini-scrum with David and then we started working on our projects again.</p>
