<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read the first entry in the series for context, you can do so here.
Over the course of a professional career you tend to acquire a lot of tools, regardless of the industry. I wanted to list some of my favorites in this blog entry, as well as some of my lessons learned from each. I&rsquo;ll go into greater detail for each in the future, but for now I&rsquo;ll just cover some of my major takeaways from each.</p>

<p>Way back in 2008 I was a sophomore at West Point. I had to pick a major that I would pursue for the next three years. Unlike most schools, I’d be more or less stuck with what I picked because changing my major halfway through and staying in school for another year was not an option. I had narrowed my choices down to Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science. I had considered Chemical Engineering at the onset of college, but had ruled it out after the joy that was organic chemistry my 2nd semester of freshman year.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read the first entry in the series for context, you can do so here. Now, about Android. Of the two native platforms (iOS &amp; Android) I&rsquo;ve found Android far and away to be the more challenging of the two. It&rsquo;s more verbose, more error-prone, and less standardized. Google went a long way at Google I/O 2017 in resolving the first two with official support of Kotlin, and the last one with the adoption of the MVVM architecture pattern.</p>

<p>So I was reading Ted Whang’s blog the other day and I saw something that made me chuckle. Ted’s blog centers around his experience at Coding Dojo. In one entry in particular he says that he “personally has an obsession with parallax scrolling. Even if you don&rsquo;t know what parallax scrolling means, you probably have ran into one and thought to yourself, &ldquo;man this is really cool&rdquo;. “ I had to laugh because I felt (and still feel) the same way.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read the first entry in the series for context, you can do so here. Given that my work is primarily based around development of the client applications, I&rsquo;m going to have an outsized quantity of iOS and Android lessons learned compared to the other stacks. I&rsquo;ll do as well as I can to stagger them with other languages and tools (for example, the preceding entries on Python, React, and C#), but will probably eventually have a few back-to-back entries of iOS and Android.</p>
