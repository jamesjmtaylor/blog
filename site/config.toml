I take great pride in delivering delightful experiences to users of my mobile applications, and learned Sketch, Zeplin, and Lottie to make up for the lack of a designer on my personal projects. I quickly realized  though that an app is all for naught without a solid backend to support it.  So I used the Java from my native Android development to jumpstart into Spring Boot server development.  Now, with full command of the stack I've returned to delivering holistic applications for my users."
