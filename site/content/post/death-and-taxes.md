Modified AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is the sum of all your income.  AGI > 228k = Can NOT contribute to Roth IRA.  Charitable contributions are NOT deducted from AGI unless you contribute more than 60% of your AGI (unlikely).

You should receive a Form 3922 when you participate in ESPP.  This will be needed for calculating tax obligations.

Proceeds (1099-B) - cost basis (price paid, also 1099-B)  -  Ordinary Income Recognized (W-2) = Capital gains/loss

FMV = Fair Market Value

Can sell ESPP shares in 2 ways:

Qualifying disposition: Hold shares more than 2 years from grant date (start of offering period) AND 1 year after purchase date. 

* Sale Price - Purchase price = ordinary income 

OR

* Grant Date Price - Discounted grant date price = ordinary income 

Disqualifying disposition.

* FMV at purchase - Purchase Price = ordinary income 

NEED to include Supplementary information from the E-Trade website and manually adjust the cost basis (the 1099-B will not have the adjusted cost basis) This is necessary because Dexcom will record ESPP income on W-2, but it is also recorded by E-Trade on 1099-B, effectively double counting the income for tax purposes. 

Manual tax reporting, use Form 8949.  Using tax software, use tax software’s education to find out how to manually adjust cost basis.

Example of qualifying vs disqualifying adjustment below:

Ordinary income is not reflected on your RSU 1099-B either.  Need to either check W-2 or Confirmation of Release” sent by company. 

Alternatively check your RSU website for a “Stock Plan Transactions Supplement” under tax documents in order to get your adjusted cost basis. See below for an example:
