The past couple months I've been working my way through different LeetCode problems because they force me to grapple with problems that I don't really see in my day to day work.  I've shifted from HackerRank in order to increase the variety of problems that I see. The problems I've been working on are part of a curated set called "[LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)".  They cover string operations, two pointer problems, sliding windows, prefix sums, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, depth first/breadth first search, heaps, bits, and dynamic programming.  I've completed about a dozen problems so far. 

Having used platforms like LeetCode for the past several years, I grant that they're incredibly useful for preparing for an interview, especially when they're the platform that the initial screening interviews are held on.  I do have three complaints/areas that they could improve on though:

1. Code completion: this isn't 1983.  We have more sophisticated tools than Notepad.  Even [Vim](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vim-autocomplete) and [Emacs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete) have code completion.  The fact that I have to have a second browser open to look up function and parameter names when working on LeetCode or Hackerrank problems is ridiculous, and always leaves me feeling a little dirty.

2. Problem quality: I can't tell you how frustrating it is for me to bang my head against a wall trying to optimize an "easy" problem for hours on end, just to look at the editorial and be told "Here is a more mathematical approach to the problem. Note that this approach is more advanced/elegant and you should not feel discouraged if you do not come up with it on the spot in an interview."  If I can't come up with the optimized solution without knowing some esoteric math rule ("interviewers hate this one weird trick!") then why mark it as "easy"?!

3. Locked Editorials: The idea that because
