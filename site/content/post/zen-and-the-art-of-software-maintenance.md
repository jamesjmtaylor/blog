Out-of-sequence setbacks occur when you disassemble a motorcycle and then try to reassemble it but do so out of order.  An example in software maintenance would be the refactoring of tech debt.  How many times have you reworked a class and its functions to be more clear or less bug-prone only to find that it doesn't quite work like it did before the refactor?  The fix, of course, is
