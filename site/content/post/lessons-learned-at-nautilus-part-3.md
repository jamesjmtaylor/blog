<img style="float: left; margin:0 2em 1em 0; width: 33%" src="/img/blog/droid.png"/> In my two and a half years at Nautilus I learned a tremendous amount about IoT, Hardware, Software, Data Science, and myself in general.  This will be the last entry in Nautilus lessons learned series and will cover the benefits of Android OS for IoT and how hardware can unintentionally impact software.

One of the best parts of my time at Nautilus was all the firmware and electrical engineers that I got to interact with and learn from.  My undergraduate degree was in computer science.  The syllabus had exactly two electrical engineering courses, "Digital Computer Logic" and "Introduction to Computer Architecture". I got a little bit into electromagnetic theory and Maxwell's equations in my Advanced Physics course, but ultimately only scratched the surface of all the content available in electrical engineering.   My computer science education covered a lot of the theory of computer operation and programming.  Data structures, algorithms, operating systems, computer graphics, etc.  

Nautilus, as a fitness equipment company, was enmeshed in firmware and hardware development as a neccesity.  As the architect for the embedded version of the JRNY application
