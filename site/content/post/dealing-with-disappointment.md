At the start of the year I wrote a [blog entry](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/2023-resolutions/) outlining my goals for the year, specifically:

* Learn Rust. Use it to build a StarCraft bot.
* Climb three new mountains.
* Complete the Mazamas Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

I accomplished the first pretty early on.  You can read about it [here](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/starcraft-rust-bot/).  The second took a little longer, but I eventually summitted three new mountains, [Mt. Hood](https://www.fs.usda.gov/mthood), [Old Snowy](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/old-snowy-mountain-elk-pass), and [Three Finger Jack](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/three-fingered-jack-via-pacific-crest-trail). In order to complete Intermediate Climbing School however, I first had to be accepted.

I accomplished all the pre-requisites well in advance.  I volunteered with the Mazamas, teaching courses, performing trail maintenance, and leading hikes. I spent hours painstakingly crafting my ICS application essays and climbing resume. I also aced the ICS entrance exam, performing better than many of my peers.  

And yet, after all of that, I received a simple three sentence email:

"We're sorry to let you know that you were not selected for this year's Intermediate Climbing School.



This year ICS had a record number of applicants. There simply was not enough space for everyone who was qualified. We hope you continue to climb and learn, and please consider applying to ICS next year."

My gut reaction was one of crushing defeat, bordering on despondence.  If I couldn't get in this year, after all I had done, how could I expect next year to be any different? Which brings us to the topic of this month's entry, dealing with disappointment.
