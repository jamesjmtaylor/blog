At the start of the year I wrote a [blog entry](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/2023-resolutions/) outlining my goals for the year, specifically:

* Learn Rust. Use it to build a StarCraft bot.
* Climb three new mountains.
* Complete Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

I accomplished the first pretty early on.  You can read about it [here](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/starcraft-rust-bot/).  The second took a little longer, but I eventually summitted three new mountains, [Mt. Hood](https://www.fs.usda.gov/mthood), [Old Snowy](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/old-snowy-mountain-elk-pass), and [Three Finger Jack](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/three-fingered-jack-via-pacific-crest-trail). Which brings me to the topic of this blog, dealing with disappointment.  

I accomplished all the pre-requisites for Intermediate Climbing School.  I spent several hours crafting my application essays and climbing resume. I aced the entrance exam, performing better than many of my peers.
