<img style="float: left; margin:0 1em 1em 0; width: 33%" src="/img/blog/security.jpg"> If you have not had a chance to read the first entry in the series for context, <a href="/post/after-action-review-aar/">you can do so here</a> 

It's been a almost exactly a year since I did <a href="/post/aar-pt-6-tools/">my last Tools AAR entry</a>, so I figured it was about time that I had a new entry on my lessons learned.  This post focuses almost exclusively on security tools.

* You can download the Sourcefogre .zip "dex2jar" and run it to convert an android apk file to a jar. From there you can run the java Decompiler to examine the code the former apk contained.
* 
* To unzip a file on MacOS from the terminal you can type "unzip " and then drag & drop the file into the terminal window.
* 
* If debugging curl with Charles, add "--proxy 127.0.0.1:8888 --insecure" after the url block in the terminal command.
* 
* Postman includes "/r" and "/n" characters in its curl code export. Make sure to remove t hem before actually executing.
* 
* To set a variable to the result of a function in curl wrap the function and arguments in a "$(...)" block.
* 
* In Postgres always use VARCHAR instead of CHAR. CHAR will append whitespace to match the maximum length specified by the database.
* 
* You can erase cached credentials in Postman by clicking the "cookies" button, right next to the "code" button.
* 
* Zeplin and Sketch now support flows, removing the need for apps like proto.io.
* 
* You can vpn into a machine as long as you have it's ip address and password. Just open the terminal and type "open vnc://0.0.0.0" (replace the 0's with your desired machines IP address)
* 
* If your Mac crashes with a kernel panic every 30 minutes try emptying your hard drive with the Mac Daisy Disk application.
* 
* You can evaluate an expression while debugging in Visual Studio Code by using the "Debugger Console" window and typing in expressions to evaluate by the caret. 
* 
* Whenever you instantiate or upgrade a microservices stack make sure to double check the stack's tag, especially when the orchestration framework that you are using has an 'auto-upgrade' feature.
* 
* You can export Charles proxy debugging sessions to assist teammates in troubleshooting server errors.
* 
* SQLIte (Used on iOS and Android) does not support the DROP COLUMN command.
* 
* SSLLabs can tell you if a certificate is valid, and if not, what's wrong with it.
* 
* When viewing backgrounded apps on iOS and Android you're actually viewing screenshots of each app when they were backgrounded.
* 
* In design "desire lines" are the worn game trails of consumers. Ideally you see where they form first and then build the sidewalks to accomodate them.
* 
* In design "feature dilution" is that idea that every new feature weakens the impact of existing features, including the core value propositions.
* 
* The 5 point rule in design is the idea that you shouldn't exceed more than 5 unique fonts, colors, or text-sizes on a page.
* 
* You should avoid boxes within boxes in layout design wherever possible.
* 
* The integration of animations into a boring workflow can make it more engaging and reduce user drop-off.
* 
* Animations can also be used in a design to enable progressive disclosure of information (drill-down interfaces).
* 
* In security SHA1 = 160 bits, SHA2 = 256 or 512 bits, and SHA3 is the same size as SHA2 with some additional protections included.
* 
* In database security "Salt" is just random data input into a SHA, normally for hasing passwords.
* 
* Redis is an in memory database commonly used as part of a microservices stack. You can fluch a redis cache by running redis-cli and executing "flushall".
* 
* The primary use case for Redis was to be a fast page cacher of dynamically generated HTML.
* 
* Use mapShapes.com to render and manipulate svg map shapes quickly.
* 
* D3 (Data-Driven Documents) allow you to represent data in svgs through javascript functions.
* 
* Most Jetbrains IDE's (IntelliJ, Rider, Android Studio, etc.) support pasting a stacktrace from an external source such as a logger and interpretting it as if it was generated locally.
* 
* In Oauth2.0 there are implicit and authorization code grant types. The latter requires a client secret and token url, the former does not.
* 
* You can use "npm install tree" to get a heirarchial directory display in the terminal.
* 
* NewRelic is another crash reporting service, similar to Firebase Crashlytics.
* 
* AppFollow allows you to track App Store & Google Play reviews. It also has an optional integration with slack.
* 
* PaintCode allows you to generate dynamic UI in a sketch-like environment and then export them as autogenerated Swift or Java code.
* 
* MacOS has a built-in tool called "Digital Color Meter" that allows you to get RGB colors from the screen.
