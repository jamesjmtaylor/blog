Before we begin our critique of stoicism, it is important to understand what stoicism is, and what it is not. 

Stoicism was founded by the Greek phisolopher Zeno (pictured left) in the 3rd century BC. The stoics were one of the few philosophical movements that met in public, gathering on the poikílē stoá, or painted porch, of the Agora in Athens.  It was from this location that they derived their name, making them literally "the porch people".   The modern usage of stoic as a "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" wasn't used until 1579.  Stoic ethics are completely deterministic.  Under determinism all new events are completely determined by preceding events.  The classic stoic parable is that of the dog  tied to a cart. A wicked dog barks, pulls at the rope, and futilely fights as the cart makes its way down the road.  A stoic dog instead happily follows the cart, even if the cart ultimately injures or kills the dog. 

Prior to becoming involved in the Mazamas I had a fairly stoic outlook on life.  

"You were feeling like crap on Middle Sister— but still helped the team. We noticed this behavior— thanks for helping out, but also remember to take care of yourself— you can’t help others if you are personally compromised. You’ve got to be communicative about how you’re feeling ... stoicism doesn’t count for much in the high alpine."

Another dutchman and stoic, Wim Hof, made a much more ambitious mountaineering attempt, seeking to summit Mount Everest. 

“So I had a deep mental conversation with my foot, and it reported frostbite. I appreciated it was the right thing to turn back; extreme cold is a teacher. The lessons come to you through the body. You just listen."

Every one of those flags was at some point an extremely motivated person.  They stoically persevered into the "Death Zone", where the level of oxygen is insufficient to support human life.  They embraced their "destiny" and ultimately perished as a result.
