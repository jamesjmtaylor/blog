2023 proved to be quite the turbulent year.  Of my three[ 2023 new year's resolutions](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/2023-resolutions/), I accomplished two.  Specifically, I completed my Starcraft Rust AI (you can read about it here) and successfully summited three new mountains. My goals for 2024 are below:

* Update my Worldwide Equipment Guide app to use the new [Odin API](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/)
* Climb three new mountains.
* Complete Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

The first goal involves my Worldwide Equipment Guide app, which I made token updates to in 2022. The 2023 update was a complete rewrite of the Android and iOS apps to use Kotlin Multi-Platform (KMP) as well as the new Odin API. I was on track to complete them last year even though they weren't formally a new year's resolution.   Networking was handled by Ktor, database persistence was implemented in SQLDelight, while the user interfaces (UIs) used Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.  Unfortunately a sudden (and extensive) change in the organization of the Odin API meant that I had to basically start from scratch.  So this year I'll focus on just getting the networking and user interfaces working, and worry about data persistence in a subsequent update. 

The second and third goals are repeats of the same goals from 2023.  I wasn't accepted to ICS in 2023 despite a near perfect score on the entrance exam.  When I asked what I could do to make myself a more competitive candidate for 2024 I was told I needed to complete more alpine snow climbs.  So my plan going forward is to scale back my volunteer efforts with the Mazamas (which didn't seem to have an impact on my application) and scale up my climbing efforts.  This is all
