[Last year's resolutions](https://jjmtaylor.com/post/2024-resolutions/):

* Update my Worldwide Equipment Guide app to use the new Odin API
* Climb three new mountains.
* Start Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

I was able to summit Mount Theilsen in May, Colchuck Peak in June, and Rooster Rock in August.  I also summited Mt Hood again, this time via the West Crater Rim, and completed a winter climb of Mt. Saint Helens.  I anticipate that new summits will become increasingly difficult as the number of mountains different that I've climbed increases.  Despite that I plan to carry over last year's resolution of three new mountains into 2025.  Whic brings us to the meat of this month's post, new resolutions for 2025:

* Climb three new mountains
* Complete Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)
* Start my masters in Computer Science at OSU
