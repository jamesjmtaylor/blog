I've used HackerRank throughout my career, both when I've been screened as a candidate, as well as to screen my own candidates.  I've also used it to study algorithms and data structures.  It's a great platform for practicing and evaluating the fundamentals of Computer Science.  In the process of skills evaluation the candidate must check a box stating 

> "I will not consult/copy code from any source including a website, book, or friend/colleague to complete these tests, though may reference language documentation or use an IDE that has code completion features."

Having studied John Nash's work I'm naturally curious as to what the  Game Theory analysis of this simple statement is.  So I decided to apply what I had learned while reading [Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook](http://gametheory101.com/) (an excellent introduction to the field if you're interested) to the problem of competing candidates.  

Before we get into it, a quick primer.  Game theory is "the study of strategic interdependence."  In other words, the objective analysis of the decisions made by two or more parties and how those decisions impact the parties involved.  One of the ultimate goals of Game Theory is to determine the "Nash Equilibrium" of any given problem. The Nash Equilibrium is the set of strategies that maximizes each players outcome, regardless of the choices of the other players.  When most people think of Game Theory they think of the Prisoner's Dilemma.  Prisoner's Dilemma is the oldest and simplest game theory problem.  Two prisoners must simultaneously decide whether to confess or keep quiet.  The "Nash Equilibrium" is that both players confess. 

The technical interview process is more akin to a Game Tree
